1. Wet bhel
Wet bhel is called as ‘geela bhel’ in hindi. This recipe is for the Wet bhel puri where chutneys are added along with onions, tomatoes and boiled potatoes.

2. Dry bhel
Dry bhel is called as ‘sukha bhel‘ in hindi. In a dry bhel puffed rice is mixed with roasted peanuts, masala chana dal, spice powders, puri and sev. in the Dry bhel You simply do not add any liquid chutneys.

Three types of chutneys are added in bhel puri

Sweet tangy chutney
Green chutney
Spicy red chutney
In this bhelpuri recipe, I am sharing these three quick chutney recipes. so you don’t have to hunt around to make these chutneys and bhelpuri can be made in less than 45 minutes. The chutneys are very easy to make and do not take much time.

Apart from the three chutneys, puri or papdi and sev are also added. You make the puri and sev at home or buy from the market. I have here used baked papdi which I made at home.

Some people prefer bhel puri with chutneys and some without it. bhel is eaten with papdi or crispy fried poori. At least this is how I have them at home. But you can even have them with a spoon 🙂

There is no english translation of bhelpuri for my international readers. all I can tell you is that bhelpuri is one of the popular street food recipes from Mumbai which is now available in other parts of India as well in various avatars. Another similar recipe is Jhal muri from Kolkata and Churumuri from Karnataka.

How to make bhel puri
1. cooking potatoes – boil 1 large potato or 2 medium sized potatoes in a 2 litre pressure cooker or in a pan with enough water. If using a pressure cooker, then add water just about covering the potatoes. Add ¼ teaspoon salt and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles. Once the pressure settles down in the cooker, remove the water and place the potatoes in a bowl. Let them cool or become warm. I was making some other snack as well, so I cooked more potatoes.

Tips for making bhel puri
Bhel puri has to be served as soon as it is made and immediately. Serving even after a couple of minutes will make the whole bhel puri mixture soggy and you won’t enjoy it.
Keep all the ingredients ready before you start mixing everything for making bhel puri.
The puffed rice should be crisp. If not crisp then roast them for some minutes in a pan on a low flame till they become crisp.
You can even add grated vegetables like carrots and beetroot.
 when raw mangoes are in season then you can even add them. Addition of raw mangoes gives a very nice tangy taste and crunch.
Spice powders and the chutneys can be adjusted as per your taste buds. You can make chutney at home or even use readymade ones. Best to use homemade chutneys as you can make them as per your taste and they are fresher.

Hi Dassana – I wasn’t sure what you meant by “no English tradition for bhel puri” but thought you might like to know that there used to be two restaurants in London actually called The Bhel Puri House back in the 70s where people queued to eat the bhel puri amongst other wonderful things! One of the restaurants is still there but the food not as good as it used to be. Your recipe looks wonderful and authentic so I’m going to give it a try. I love bhel puri!5 stars

Dassana, this is my absolute top fav type of chaat. Always ate it in restaurants, never thought I’d be able to make it at home. Now there are no good Indian restaurants near me (I’m in the US), but thanks to you, I can!! Thank you as always!!
